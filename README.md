# e_commerce_bloc 
*IN THE WORKS*

A revamped flutter application

## What this is

This project is the revamped version of the old e-commerce app on my profile. This version uses BLoC pattern and clears up the mess from the old one. Widgets are more structured and grouped making it easier to alter. Streams everywhere.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
